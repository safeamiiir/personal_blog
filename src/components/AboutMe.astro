    This blog is a space where I share practical insights and experiences that have helped me and, I hope, might be useful to othersâ€”or even my future self.
    Whether it's a conference talk, a workshop, a class discussion, or a blog post, I aim to provide value by documenting and sharing meaningful knowledge.
    <br/>
    Feel free to explore and connect with me as we journey together.
