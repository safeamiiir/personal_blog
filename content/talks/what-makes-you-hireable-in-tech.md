For years, the stereotypical image of someone working in tech was a hoodie in a dark room, but most people in this industry actually spend far more time in conversations, problem-solving sessions and cross-functional work than silently typing away.
Many aspiring or early-career professionals still believe success is about collecting tools and stacking their CV with technical buzzwords, yet progression is rarely blocked by a lack of hard skills; it’s usually held back by missing soft skills, ownership and the ability to handle ambiguity.

In this conversation, [CareerSol](https://www.linkedin.com/company/careersol/) sits down with Amirreza Safehian, who started as a front-end developer and is now a senior software engineer at a leading UK quantum computing start-up, to unpack what truly makes you hireable in tech today.
He shares practical ways he stays intentional about his growth, how people with no experience can build a portfolio that actually demonstrates ability, and what makes a CV and cover letter stand out instead of blending in.
