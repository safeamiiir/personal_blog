On October 12, 2024, I had the opportunity to conduct a hands-on **Chrome DevTools workshop**. This was a practical session aimed at helping trainees unlock the full potential of DevTools for inspecting, debugging, and optimizing their web projects.

- Part C: Debugging the issues [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KkTRHRR6KJZj_CndKu95PZ2G2QpOsCN2/view?usp=drive_link)

## Workshop Highlights

The workshop was structured around real-world challenges and practical exercises. Participants were guided through the powerful tools hidden within Chrome DevTools, from the **Elements Panel** to **Lighthouse Audits**.

Here's what we covered:

### 1. Inspecting the DOM

The first exercise involved understanding the **Document Object Model (DOM)** and inspecting elements on the page. Key tasks included:

- Identifying **CSS Variables** used for design tokens (e.g., fonts, colours, and spacing).
- Modifying the page's styles directly within the **Styles panel**.
- Observing the effects of real-time changes to CSS properties.

### 2. Experimenting with CSS Variables

To demonstrate how easily modern CSS can be adjusted, participants experimented with:

- Adjusting values of CSS variables (e.g., `--space` and `--brand-color`).
- Predicting and observing the results of changesâ€”like increasing font sizes or tweaking colours.

### 3. Using the Grid Inspector

Modern websites rely on **CSS Grid** for layout. We explored:

- Enabling the **Grid Badge** in DevTools.
- Using the **Grid Editor** to manipulate and experiment with page layouts.

This exercise gave participants a new appreciation for how web layouts are visualized and debugged.

### 4. Running Lighthouse Audits

No DevTools session is complete without exploring **Lighthouse**. We ran audits to analyze performance, accessibility, and best practices. Lighthouse gave actionable feedback, helping participants identify issues and understand how to fix them.

- Issues were reviewed.
- Detailed explanations were explored, empowering developers to improve their code quality.
