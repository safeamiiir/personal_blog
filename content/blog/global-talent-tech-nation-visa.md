## Introduction

If you already know the basics of the **UK Global Talent Visa**, this article is for you. I’ll share a quick and practical way to figure out whether the **Tech Nation route** is right for you — based entirely on my personal experience.

My goal here is to **demystify the process** and give you a clear idea of what to expect, without repeating what’s already on the official pages.

## 🚫 What This Article Doesn’t Cover

- The **benefits** of this visa (especially compared to the Skilled Worker visa)
- The **application process** (Stage 1 and Stage 2) or where to apply
- Any other Global Talent Visa routes — not the **Academic**, **Arts and Culture**, or **Awards** ones

This post is **only** about the **Tech Nation route**.

## 📘 The One and Only Official Source

Start here: [https://technation.io/global-talent-visa/](https://technation.io/global-talent-visa/)
Then click **READ THE GUIDANCE** — currently, it redirects to [this Notion guide](https://technation-globaltalentvisa-guide.notion.site/) (though it may change, so always begin from the main link).

### How to Use It

1. Treat this guide as **the only source of truth**. If it’s not there, it’s not necessarily reliable.
2. Always read the **most recent changelogs**. At the time I’m writing this, the most important one is from **22 January 2025**. The **4 August 2025** update is mainly about the visa application process itself.

## 💬 Unofficial Tech Nation forum

Check out the community at [https://discourse.tnvisaforum.org/](https://discourse.tnvisaforum.org/) — You can find useful topics.

Here’s how I suggess using it:

1. Read real cases — especially those that were **rejected**, to understand feedback and pitfalls.
2. Learn from others’ experiences to **educate yourself about the process**.
3. Ask questions if you’re confused — it helps both you and future applicants.

## 🧾 Core Documents You’ll Need

See the **“Document Checklist”** section in the Tech Nation guidance for the official version. This is just my short version.

### 1. Personal Statement (up to 1000 words)

- Directly answer the questions in the guidance.
- It’s one of the **first things** assessors read — treat it as your story summary.

### 2. CV (up to 3 pages)

- Prepare this **last**, once your evidences and story are clear.
- This is not your usual job CV — it should highlight your **achievements relevant to the visa**.
- Include what doesn’t fit elsewhere but still strengthens your case.

### 3. Three Letters of Recommendation

- Get them from the **most senior people** in your network — CEOs, CTOs, Founders, etc.
- Draft a version that ticks [**all the requirements**](https://arc.net/l/quote/ptnghvhx) listed in the Tech Nation guidance.
- Each referee should confirm they’ve known and worked closely with you for **over 12 months**.
- Follow the **correct signing format** — check examples on the Tech Nation Forum; don’t risk your case by taking this lightly.

### 4. Evidence: The Core of Your Application

You can submit **up to 10 pieces of evidence**, and you must provide **at least 6** in total.

- **At least 2 for the mandatory criterion**, and
- **Select only 2 (out of 4) optional criteria**, and provide **at least 2 evidences per each**.

In other words, the minimum is **6 evidences** — but that’s usually not enough for a strong case.

Note: **Everything should be within the last 5 years** — evidence older than that is generally not considered valid, so focus on your most recent and relevant achievements.

👉 **My personal recommendation:**
Plan for around **10 evidences** in total — for example:
- **4 evidences** for your **Mandatory Criterion**, and
- **3 evidences** for each of your **two chosen Optional Criteria**.

This structure gives assessors a more rounded and convincing view of your achievements while staying within the official limit of 10.

### 4.1 Mandatory Criterion

- Recognition as a **Leading Talent in Digital Technology**

### 4.2 Optional Criteria

Select ONLY 2 of these, then prove at least 2 for each.

- **OC1:** Innovation — building or leading something genuinely new
- **OC2:** Volunteering, Mentorship, Public Speaking, or other contributions outside your main job
- **OC3:** Impact — measurable achievements or outcomes
- **OC4:** Academic Research — relevant published or peer-reviewed work

Check this **Evidence Checklist spreadsheet** for clarity:
👉 [Tech Nation Visa Checklist (Google Sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PbyuokO2h5baY2awsmwHAXWKWYNZBGg0)

It’s an excellent way to map your evidences and see what fits where.

## 🪄 Final Notes from My Experience

1. **Collect everything** — make a bulk document with *anything* remotely relevant from the last 5 years. You’ll build your case from that.
2. **Focus on yourself** — this visa is about *you*, not your company. Replace “we” and “our team” with “I” and “me.”
3. **Tell a consistent story** — your Personal Statement, CV, Recommendation Letters, and Evidences should reinforce the same narrative.
4. **Design your evidences well** — clarity matters. Combine text, images, and data neatly. Use the “Evidence Description” column in the [checklist spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PbyuokO2h5baY2awsmwHAXWKWYNZBGg0) to make each piece self-explanatory.

**In short:**
Start from the [official Tech Nation page](https://technation.io/global-talent-visa/), read the full guidance, learn from real cases, and tell a strong, consistent story that makes your impact clear.

That’s how you make this visa route work for you — confidently and cleanly.
