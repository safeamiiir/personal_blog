![TLDR; Global Talent Visa -- Tech Nation route post cover](/images/blog/global-talent-tech-nation-visa_cover_1200*627.png)

If you already know the basics of the **UK Global Talent Visa**, this article is for you. I’ll share a quick and practical way to figure out whether the **Tech Nation route** is right for you or not. This is based entirely on my personal experience.

My goal here is to **demystify the process** and give you a clear idea of what to expect, without repeating what’s already on the official pages.

## 🚫 What This Article Doesn’t Cover

- The **benefits** of this visa (especially compared to the Skilled Worker visa)
- The **application process** (Stage 1 and Stage 2) or where to apply
- Any other Global Talent Visa routes, not the **Academic**, **Arts and Culture**, or **Awards** ones

This post is **only** about the **Tech Nation route**.

## 📘 The One and Only Official Source

Start here: [technation.io/global-talent-visa](https://technation.io/global-talent-visa/). Then click **READ THE GUIDANCE**. It currently redirects you to [this Notion guide](https://technation-globaltalentvisa-guide.notion.site/), though it may change, so always begin from the main link.

### How to Use It

1. Treat this guide as **the only source of truth**. If it’s not there, it’s not necessarily reliable.
2. Always read the **most recent changelogs**. At the time of writing, the most important one is from **22 January 2025**. (The **4 August 2025** update mainly concerns the visa application process itself)

## 💬 Unofficial Tech Nation Forum

Check out the community at [discourse.tnvisaforum.org](https://discourse.tnvisaforum.org/). You can find useful topics there.

Here’s how I suggest using it:

1. Read real cases, especially those that were **rejected**, to understand the feedback they received from the Tech Nation assessors and pitfalls.
2. Learn from others’ experiences to **educate yourself about the process**.
3. Ask questions if you’re confused. This helps both you and future applicants.

## 🧾 Core Documents You’ll Need

See the **“Document Checklist”** section in the Tech Nation guidance for the official version. This is just my short version.

### 1. Personal Statement (up to 1000 words)

- Directly answer the questions in the guidance. Even if you’re already living in the UK, don’t skip any. Make sure you clearly answer each one.
- It’s one of the **first things** assessors read. Treat it as your application’s summary.

### 2. CV (up to 3 pages)

- Prepare this **last**, once your pieces of evidence and story are clear.
- This is not your usual job CV. It should highlight your **achievements relevant to the visa**.
- Include what doesn’t fit elsewhere in your application, but still strengthens your case.

### 3. Three Letters of Recommendation

- Get them from the **most senior people** in your network: CEOs, CTOs, founders, and similar. You’d be surprised how willing people are to help, so don’t hesitate to ask.
- Draft a version that ticks [**all the requirements**](https://arc.net/l/quote/ptnghvhx) listed in the Tech Nation guidance.
- Each referee should confirm they’ve known and worked closely with you for **over 12 months**.
- Follow the **correct signing format**. Check examples on the Tech Nation forum, like [this example](https://discourse.tnvisaforum.org/t/docusign-solution-tip-2023-heres-how-to-auto-include-certificate-dont-merge-pdfs/6348), and don’t risk your case by taking this lightly.

### 4. Evidence: The Core of Your Application

You can submit **up to 10 pieces of evidence**, and you must provide **at least 6** in total.

- **At least 2 for the mandatory criterion**
- **Select only 2 (out of 4) optional criteria** and provide **at least 2 pieces of evidence per criterion**

In other words, the minimum is **6 pieces of evidence**. That is usually not enough for a strong case.

Note: **Everything should be within the last 5 years**. Evidence older than that is generally not considered valid, so focus on your most recent and relevant achievements.

👉 **My personal recommendation:**
Plan for around **10 pieces of evidence** in total. For example:

- **4 pieces of evidence** for your **Mandatory Criterion**
- **3 pieces of evidence** for each of your **two chosen Optional Criteria**

This structure gives assessors a more rounded and convincing view of your achievements while staying within the official limit of 10.

### 4.1 Mandatory Criterion

Yes! This one is simple to explain. You just need to show one thing:

- Recognition as a **Leading Talent in Digital Technology**

Examples of this can be found in the Tech Nation guidance [here](https://arc.net/l/quote/fmxanedb).

### 4.2 Optional Criteria

Select **ONLY** 2 of these, then provide at least 2 pieces of evidence for each.

- **OC1:** Innovation, building or leading something genuinely new
- **OC2:** Volunteering, mentorship, public speaking, or other contributions outside your main role
- **OC3:** Impact, measurable achievements or outcomes
- **OC4:** Academic research, relevant published or peer-reviewed work

Check this **evidence checklist spreadsheet** for clarity:\
[Tech Nation Visa Checklist (Google Sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PbyuokO2h5baY2awsmwHAXWKWYNZBGg0)

It’s an excellent way to map your pieces of evidence and see what fits where.

## 🪄 Final Notes from My Experience

1. **Collect everything**. Make a bulk document with _anything_ remotely relevant from the last 5 years. You’ll build your case from that.
2. **Focus on yourself**. This visa is about _you_, not your company. Replace “we” and “our team” with “I” and “me.”
3. **Tell a consistent story**. Your Personal Statement, CV, Recommendation Letters, and pieces of evidence should reinforce the same narrative.
4. **Design your pieces of evidence well**. Clarity matters. Combine text, images, and data neatly. Use the “Evidence Description” column in the [checklist spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PbyuokO2h5baY2awsmwHAXWKWYNZBGg0) to make each piece self-explanatory.
